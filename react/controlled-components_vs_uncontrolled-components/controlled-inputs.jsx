// Controlled inputs accept their current value as a prop and a callback to change that value. That implies that the value of the input has to live in the React state somewhere. Typically, the component that renders the input (like a form component) saves that in its state:

const Form = () => { 
 const [value, setValue] = useState(""); 

 const handleChange = (e) => { 
   setValue(e.target.value) 
 } 

 return ( 
   <form> 
     <input 
       value={value} 
       onChange={handleChange} 
       type="text" 
     /> 
   </form> 
 ); 
}; 

/*
Every time you type a new character, the handleChange function is executed. It receives the new value of the input, and then it sets it in the state. In the code example above, the flow would be as follows:

The input starts out with an empty string: “”

You type “a” and handleChange gets an “a” attached in the event object, as e.target.value, and subsequently calls setValue with it. The input is then updated to have the value of “a”. 

You type “b” and handleChange gets called with e.target.value being “ab”.and sets that to the state. That gets set into the state. The input is then re-rendered once more, now with value = "ab" .

This flow pushes the value changes to the form component instead of pulling like the ref example from the uncontrolled version. Therefore, the Form component always has the input's current value without needing to ask for it explicitly.

As a result, your data (React state) and UI (input tags) are always in sync. Another implication is that forms can respond to input changes immediately, for example, by:

Instant validation per field 

Disabling the submit button unless all fields have valid data 

Enforcing a specific input format, like phone or credit card numbers

// The file input type
/*
There are some specific form inputs that are always uncontrolled, like the file input tag. 

In React, an <input type="file" /> is always an uncontrolled component because its value is read-only and can't be set programmatically. 

The following example illustrates how to create a ref to the DOM node to access any files selected in the form submit handler:

*/

const Form = () => { 
 const fileInput = useRef(null); 

 const handleSubmit = (e) => { 
   e.preventDefault(); 
   const files = fileInput.current.files; 
   // Do something with the files here 
 } 

 return ( 
   <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}> 
     <input 
       ref={fileInput} 
       type="file" 
     /> 
   </form> 
 ); 
}; 

// Conclusion
/*
Conclusion 

Uncontrolled components with refs are fine if your form is incredibly simple regarding UI feedback. However, controlled input fields are the way to go if you need more features in your forms. 

Evaluate your specific situation and pick the option that works best for you.

The below table summarizes the features that each one supports:
