/*

Step 1

The first test scenario has the following specification:

User is able to submit the form if the score is lower than 5 and additional feedback is provided

The test scenario already contains some initial code that acts as boilerplate before getting to the bulk of the test, in particular:

Two variables that hold the desired state of the form, a score of 3 and an additional comment.

A mock function that is called when submitting the form.

The rendering of the form component.

The final assertion that should make the test pass.

If you run as it is, the test will fail stating that the mock function has not been called at all. That is because no interactions have occurred yet and itâ€™s your task to write those.
